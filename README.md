One player game which uses a greedy and dynamic programming algorithm.

The Basic Coins-in-a-Line Game.  The player is given various coins.
The objective is to take turns with another player (in this case the program) and pick coins such that
the player's coin value at the end of the game is higher than the opponent's total.
There are two modes: EASY and HARD.  EASY Mode uses a greedy approach, whereas HARD Mode utilizes
a dynamic programming strategy.
